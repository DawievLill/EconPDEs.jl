	\begin{itemize}
		\item Used in EconPDEs
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	The Jacobian corresponding to a second-order PDE $F(f, f_x, f_{xx})$ with first-order finite difference scheme a Triangular Matrix of size $n_x$
			\item The Jacboain corresponding to a system of second-order PDE $F(f^1, f^1_x, f^1_{xx}, \dots, f^J, f^J_x, f^J_{xx})$ with first-order finite difference scheme is a Sparse Matrix of size $n_x \times J$ with non zeros subdiagonal at  $i\times n_x-1, i \times n_x, i \times n_x +1$ for $i \in [[-J, J]]$. \par
			Alternatively, it can be written as a Block Triangular Matrix where blocks are dense of size $J\times J$ by writing the system as $f^1(x_1), f^1(x_2), \dots f^J(x_1)$, etc
			\item  The Jacobian corresponding to the system $F(f, \nabla f, f_{x_2}, f_{x_1x_1}, f_{x)y}, f_{yy})$  with first-order finite difference scheme is a Block Triangular Matrix of size $n_x\times n_y$ where each block is itself a Triangular Matrix. \par
			Alternatively, it can be written as a Block Triangular Matrix where blocks are dense of size $2\times 2$
		\end{itemize}
		In summary, EconPDEs would benefit from specialization on Triangular Matrix and Block Triangular Matrix (with blocks either dense or Triangular themselves).\par
		A package that wants to solve PDEs using high-order finite difference scheme would benefit from specialization on BandedMatrix / Block Banded Matrix
		\item Used by Jesse Perla
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Some problems in econmics have the form of a system $F(f, f_x, f_{xx})$, and $\int f(x) g(x) =1$. where $g$ is known. IN this case, the Jacobian is a Triangular matrix + dense row.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Others
		\begin{itemize}		
			\item 	$F(f, f_x, f_{xx})$ with $n-th$ order finite difference scheme a Banded Matrix with band size $n$.
